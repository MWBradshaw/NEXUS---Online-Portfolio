            <p>Hi! My name is Matthew Bradshaw and I am an aspiring front-end developer. As a young child, I always had an interest in art and technology and I see front end development as a way to combine those two passions.</p>
            <p>Outside of that, I enjoy playing the guitar, exercising and reading.</p>
